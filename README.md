# FBHash : A New Similarity Hashing Scheme for Digital Forensics 
## [D. Chang et al. / Digital Investigation 29 (2019) S113eS123]

This is an implementation of the mentioned paper. The core idea behind the FbHashing scheme is to identify frequently occuring
chunks in document and use it to find the similarity of the document with another document. In another terms, it is used to 
fingerprint a document to identify interesting pieces of information that will aid in digital forensic investigations. 

The whole process occurs as follows.
- Take two document of length N. For our ease of demonstration, I've added two simple data objects within the source code itself.
Each of them are 52 characters long and include only the uppercase and lowercase ASCII characters. 
- For each document do the following
- First find the chunks in a document. For that we slice the document into numerous pieces with length 7. Each new chunk is generated by removing the first character from the preceeding chunk and adding another one at the end from the document supplied.
